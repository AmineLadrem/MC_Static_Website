                    Mobile and Desktop. The activities of the Dev team will focus on two main points Learning and
                    Building. Just like any coder community the core strength of the Dev team relies in its members and
                    their willingness to exchange knowledge and help each other while solving coding challenges. To
                    contribute to the success of the Micro Club’s general goals of work, we encourage Dev members to use
                    their coding skills and passion to solve problems in team work but more importantly to be curious

                <dd>- Multimedia is a special section in MC,because it doesn't involve codes websites or
                    any other technical detail.One only needs to have a vision and work hard enough to
                    visualise it,the final result is a video,a picture,and sometimes even a sound.
                    Now we can't do this section justice because we learn and make various types of media,but
                    let's just site the important ones which are short film,animated shorts,aftermovie
                    video,music.etc </dd>

                    this section is all about robotics. From the understanding of each
                    component and how to consult and assemble them to program them
                    and make it functional. This section believe in one thing in that we can
